To the Editor:
Re “As Politics Meets Power, Harassment Flourishes” (news article, Nov. 3):
As a political industry recruiter, I have heard far too many stories from young, aspiring women who come to Washington seeking to make their mark and who instead feel demeaned by those in power.
After such a damaging election season, we have a professional and moral obligation to send a clear message that such behavior will not be tolerated in any of our legislatures. Congress should serve as a model to the statehouses by establishing a culture that condemns sexual harassment and a process for addressing grievances when they occur.
One simple step Congress should take on that path is to enforce anti-sexual-harassment training for all staff members and officials. Such programs are standard in most workplaces, and are mandatory in all federal agencies. Why not in Congress?
The body housing the highest elected leaders in our land should be held to the highest standards of behavior, not be exempt from them.
