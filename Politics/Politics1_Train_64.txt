“Weiner,” “13th,” “Eagle Huntress” and “O.J.: Made in America” were among the 15 finalists for the best feature documentary Oscar, according to a shortlist released by the academy on Tuesday.
There were a few notable omissions from the finalists, which were selected from 145 submissions: despite predictions, Barbara Kopple’s “Miss Sharon Jones!” did not make the cut, nor did Werner Herzog’s “Into the Inferno,” or “Jim: The James Foley Story.”
Still, most of the finalists have been the subject of awards chatter and, in the case of “O.J.: Made in America,” multiple awards already. The five nominees will be announced Jan. 24, along with the rest of this year’s Oscar nominees. Here is the complete shortlist:
“Cameraperson”
“Command and Control”
“The Eagle Huntress”
“Fire at Sea”
“Gleason”
“Hooligan Sparrow”
“I Am Not Your Negro”
“The Ivory Game”
“Life, Animated”
“O.J.: Made in America”
“13th”
“Tower”
“Weiner”
“The Witness”
