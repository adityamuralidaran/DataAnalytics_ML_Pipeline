Re “The Lying Game” (column, Sept. 23): Poor Paul Krugman, stuck in the antiquated and quaint notion that reporters are journalists and that journalism is about reporting the “facts.” That may have been true once, and may still be the case for newspapers to some degree, but it is clearly no longer applicable to television news.
The endless panels parsing Donald Trump’s lies into oblivion, the expansion of minutiae into headline news, the countdown clocks to nonevents — TV coverage has morphed from journalism into telemarketing.
The debates will be no different since facts and truth have no role to play on television, because everything is about impact and impression as opposed to reality. Lies are simply tactics, perfectly acceptable as long as the “brand” is consistent and the message relentless. Breaking News, CNN’s tag line, is not just a snappy logo. It is an admission; the news is broken all right.

On the subject of truthfulness, the candidates’ differences might be summed up as follows: Hillary Clinton has a tortured relationship with the truth, which makes her not too different from many politicians. Donald Trump has a tortured relationship with reality, which makes him dangerous. We can take our pick.

Re “The Clinton Calendar” (column, Sept. 23):
David Brooks posits that Hillary Clinton is running an election campaign from the 20th century. Yet an Op-Ed essay running the same day (“Why Trump Won’t Save the Rust Belt,” by Edward McClelland) tells us that Donald Trump promises the workers of Michigan a return to 20th-century jobs and prosperity. Exactly who isn’t getting it?
