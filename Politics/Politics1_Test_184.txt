To the Editor:
Re “Putting Food Issues on Politicians’ Plates” (Food section, July 27):
Our nation’s food system and federal food policies have profound impacts on critical issues of our day, but are largely absent in political discourse. It has been estimated that we could save 70 percent on health care costs, amounting to trillions of dollars each year, by eating better. But, ironically, our food system is subsidized to promote unhealthy foods, like fat-laden cheese.
Politicians should be aware of the fact that animal agriculture is a major contributor to climate change and our planet’s most significant environmental problems. But rather than requiring factory farms to act more responsibly, they are relying on taxpayers to help clean up the mess.
What we eat is one of our most important decisions every day. Our food can either promote health, or it can make us sick. Agriculture can contribute to vibrant, healthy communities, or it can undermine them. Farmers can use scarce natural resources responsibly, or they can squander and deplete them.
Unfortunately, American farm policies have enabled a harmful system to take root. It doesn’t have to be this way. As consumers become more concerned about our broken food system, they are voting with their dollars. There is growing demand for organic produce, and farmers markets are spreading along with community gardens.
Consumers want nourishing food, and they are interested in supporting a more responsible and sustainable food system. It’s time for political leaders to step up to the plate and do their part.
