To the Editor:
“An Honor For Artists, Trump-Free,” by Sarah Ruhl (Op-Ed, Dec. 26), about this year’s Kennedy Center honors (sans Potus), struck me as particularly poignant.
Few things represent the best of America, or are as well loved internationally, as our artists. Even during the divisive years of the Reagan and Bush II administrations, politics could be laid aside to celebrate the best of our creative geniuses.
As I enjoy the peacefulness that a rare Christmas snowfall has brought to the Pacific Northwest lowlands, I think about the state of our country and how the current occupant of the White House cannot even bring himself to lay down partisanship for an evening to celebrate these exemplars of America’s greatness.
