WASHINGTON — During the inauguration of President-elect Donald J. Trump, there is a lot money can buy.
An “exclusive” luncheon with cabinet appointees and congressional leaders; an “intimate” dinner with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and his wife; a “ladies luncheon” with female members of the incoming first family.
The Presidential Inaugural Committee, the group responsible for planning and funding the events surrounding Mr. Trump’s swearing-in, made final on Tuesday the benefits packages it will use to entice big donors, including corporations, to open their checkbooks for $25,000 to $1 million or more.
Though the details are tailored to Mr. Trump and his circle, the packages broadly resemble those used at past inaugurations by presidents of both parties to reward their donors and fund the multimillion-dollar celebration surrounding their assumption of power.
Mr. Trump’s team is hoping to raise a record $65 million to $75 million by late January to finance a slate of events from Jan. 17 to 21 for the millions of visitors expected to flow into Washington.
There are some restrictions on who can donate — including barring registered lobbyists and “super PACs” — in line with restrictions around who can serve on the transition team and in the coming administration.
But for those allowed to write a check, the list of rewards will be long. The packages offer rare access for some of the country’s wealthiest people and most powerful corporations to Mr. Trump and his inner circle in the days around the transfer of power.
Thomas Barrack Jr., who heads the committee, said it planned to reach out broadly to political donors, including those who did not support Mr. Trump during the campaign.
“People who have not participated in this presidential campaign or were not motivated by its politics are motivated about this tribute to democracy,” Mr. Barrack said, “and to showing the world that we can argue and debate, but on Nov. 9, we move forward as one country.”
Boris Epshteyn, the director of communications for the committee, added that all excess funds the group raised would be donated to charity, in keeping with the nonpolitical nature of the inauguration.
Donors who purchase one of the five packages will have access to priority booking at hotels identified by the committee, as well as to an official shuttle system that will operate for the week.
