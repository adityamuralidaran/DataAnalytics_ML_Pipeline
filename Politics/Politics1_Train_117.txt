Re “All the People, Places and Things Donald Trump Has Insulted on Twitter Since Declaring His Candidacy for President” (a two-page chart, Oct. 24):
If Donald Trump loses on Nov. 8, he will indeed have been defeated by a rigged election: an election rigged against him by one named Donald Trump. Your litany of his destructive comments is all the proof that he or anyone should need.

Let us not forget Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the Gold Star parents of Humayun Khan, an Army captain killed in Iraq, when tallying up the people whom Donald Trump has insulted on Twitter. His insults toward these grief-stricken and patriotic parents truly made me weep with rage and despair.

I have no problem with your two-page, tiny-print list of Donald Trump insults. They are what they are. But how about some equal attention (perhaps at least half a page) to all of Hillary Clinton’s lies, insults and double dealings? They are both extremely flawed candidates.
The New York Times’s actions to influence the outcome should be limited to the editorial page, not the news section. You only prove Mr. Trump’s claim that the system is rigged.

Re “Trump Pledges to ‘Heal Divisions’ (and Sue His Accusers)” (news article, Oct. 23): Donald Trump’s threats to sue his accusers, just like his threat to sue The New York Times, are a big bluff that should be identified as such by the press.
The likelihood of his suing his 11 accusers for defamation is zero. Can you imagine Mr. Trump being deposed 11 times in the face of the Billy Bush video in which he admits he likes to assault women? Mr. Trump will be lucky if his accusers do not sue him for defamation.

If Donald Trump proceeds with his ill-advised threat to use his vast resources to sue the 11 (are there more?) women who have said he sexually abused them or made unwelcome advances, we are prepared to contribute to a defense fund on their behalf.
To the women who have come forth, you are not alone. We are confident that thousands of others will support you financially for your courageous acts of speaking out at this time on behalf of yourselves and women everywhere.

Re “Letting Go of the Secrets” (news article, Oct. 22):
Validation. That’s what Donald Trump’s boasting of sexually assaulting women has given to all of us who have had the experience of unwanted sexual contact. No, we did not do anything to warrant this. No, it is not our fault. And especially, no, we have no reason to be ashamed of what happened to us. And, finally, yes, we can speak out about our experiences now, no matter when they happened.

Re “Trump Stays Firm on Having Option to Dispute Vote” (front page, Oct. 21):
As a poll worker in numerous elections, I am offended that Donald Trump plans to question my integrity on Nov. 8. Every poll worker with whom I have ever served has been fiercely nonpartisan on Election Day. We scrupulously follow explicit rules: checking off and crosschecking each voter on our lists, and making sure each numbered ballot is accounted for.
I have never encountered a voter trying to defraud the system, but if anyone should try to do so, he or she would not get away with it!
