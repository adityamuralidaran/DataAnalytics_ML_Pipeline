Hope for US trade visit to China: A delay in harmful tariffs
WASHINGTON (AP) — When Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin leads a delegation of American officials to Beijing next week, few analysts expect them to defuse a smoldering trade conflict with China. Rather, the likeliest outcome is a more modest one: That the talks could produce a delay in the series of damaging tariffs the two nations have threatened to impose on each other's goods.

Bookings for Southwest fall after fatal accident
DALLAS (AP) — Inspections of jet engines at Southwest Airlines turned up one cracked fan blade last year but no others since last week's deadly accident that investigators believe started when a weakened blade broke off during flight. Southwest executives said Thursday that they have checked more than 25,000 fan blades since 2016 for signs of metal fatigue and the remaining 10,000 will be inspected by mid-May. They also said that bookings have dropped since the April 17 accident and will cost Southwest between $50 million and $100 million.

Oregon's struggles tracking pot reflect industrywide problem
SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Oregon is awash in data on its marijuana industry, but it has few workers to monitor and check what its legal businesses are doing. Its experience is reflective of a significant challenge in the expanding legal U.S. pot industry: the ability of governments to track their markets. Washington state recently switched tracking contractors, and quickly ran into technical problems. In California, legal sales began Jan. 1 without a vast computer system for tracking, which won't be available for months.

Facebook and other big tech stocks rally as US indexes climb
NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks climbed Thursday as Facebook led a rally by technology companies. Most of the market moved higher as interest rates declined from the four-year highs reached over the last few days. Facebook saw its stock price wither last month after its data privacy scandal, but its shares surged Thursday as the controversy didn't appear to affect the social media platform's business in the first quarter. Other big technology companies like Alphabet and Microsoft also rallied and reversed some of their recent losses.
