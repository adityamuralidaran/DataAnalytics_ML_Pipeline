Arnold Palmer was heading to a corporate golf outing in 1971 when Mark McCormack, head of the International Management Group and shepherd of Palmer’s business career, sent him a short note. He reminded his star client to use his charm on the advertising manager for Lincoln-Mercury because they were pursuing a renewal of Palmer’s endorsement deal with that division of Ford Motor.
The executive, Paul Tippitt, “apparently is not a great golf enthusiast,” McCormack wrote, “so any little ‘special attention’ that can be paid to him would I think be very worthwhile.”
Three years earlier, McCormack had counseled Palmer to add something extra to a driver he was sending as a gift to the head of Qantas, the Australian airline. “It occurred to me,” McCormack said, “that you might want to drop him a personal note telling him that you made these arrangements and that he will be receiving the club shortly.”
Palmer, who died on Sunday at 87, had an enormous influence on the sports marketing industry. His success as a corporate pitchman far outlived his competitive golf career and has provided a lesson plan in branding to succeeding generations of athletes like Michael Jordan. Well into his 80s, Palmer was doing commercials for Xarelto, the blood-thinning medication, with the basketball player Chris Bosh, the comedian Kevin Nealon and the Nascar driver Brian Vickers.
McCormack’s engineering of Palmer’s marketing, especially in its early years, is on display in correspondence that is archived at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
Letters and memos show McCormack as a courteous, ambitious steward of Palmer’s interests, from endorsements and appearances to setting up pro shops. The archive shows that McCormack hoped to start a chain of Palmer-Gary Player dry cleaners in South Africa (Palmer had a chain in the United States.) He did small favors (“I have arranged for Arnold to get a replacement Rolex watch”). He gently let down a Los Angeles woman who wanted to auction Palmer at a charity event.
And he protected Palmer, as a memo between two of his employees showed.
“Mr. McCormack said Arnold continues to be extremely upset that we give away Nicklaus products at United and Xerox dates” — or events — “and requests that we ‘cease and desist,’” it said.
As he was enriching Palmer, McCormack was building IMG into a sports and entertainment talent giant that was sold after his death to Theodore H. Forstmann’s buyout firm in 2004. It was sold again in 2013 to William Morris Endeavor and combined into WME-IMG.
Some of McCormack’s early deal-making for Palmer was for modest stakes compared with the multimillion-dollar endorsement contracts today’s athletes receive.
In 1967, he negotiated a contract for Palmer to become a global good-will ambassador and promoter for Coca-Cola for $15,000 a year, or about $108,000 in today’s dollars. The contract demanded that he make “Coca-Cola and our other products (and particularly Minute Maid orange juice) a natural and normal part of your every day life,” and that “When playing golf you would purchase Coca-Cola both for yourself and playing companions wherever and whenever practical.”
In 1972, McCormack was seeking to replace Lincoln-Mercury in Palmer’s portfolio despite a renewal offer of $25,000 a year. McCormack romanced Chrysler’s Dodge division, expressing Palmer’s enthusiasm and suggesting that Dodge sponsor a planned three-part television series, “Arnold Palmer’s Best 18 Holes in the United States,” which could spin off into dealer trips to the filming sessions, etchings of the holes, drinking glasses and place mats.
Palmer eventually signed with Cadillac, and in 1979, McCormack sent its advertising agency a list of seven ways to package the golfer’s image with the luxury carmaker. The ideas included appearances by Palmer at new car showings; production of an “attractive golf-oriented Arnold Palmer/Cadillac calendar and/or desk diary” for Cadillac dealers; Cadillac sponsorship of a documentary about Palmer; and a senior country club golf tournament in which Palmer would host the finals.
Palmer’s dissatisfaction with ProGroup, which licensed his name for golf clubs, balls, bags and gloves, led McCormack in 1976 to write to Colgate-Palmolive, which owned Ram Golf, looking for leverage or a better deal. McCormack said that Palmer was unhappy about the quality of the products made in his name, “the building of the Palmer brand and the name of the company itself,” which was supposed to change to the Palmer Company. Palmer eventually got his way, and ProGroup became the Arnold Palmer Golf Company, said Alastair Johnston, an IMG executive long associated with Palmer.
McCormack marveled at Palmer’s resilience as a golfer and personality even as he was winning less frequently.
In a letter to Ray Cave, the assistant managing editor of Sports Illustrated in late 1973, McCormack wrote that Palmer, “who only won one tournament and barely slipped over $100,000 in total world winnings, remains, despite the difficulties on the golf course, golf’s most charismatic and magnetic personality in the world, including, strangely enough, the United States, where he still commands the galleries even greater than anyone else in the game.” Later, he added, “I feel when he calms down a little about his game and doesn’t let it upset him as much as it does, that he, too, is likely to have a win or two in major events.”
In a typically informative note written in 1975, McCormack laid out a pending deal with Allstate, which wanted Palmer to help its marketing in Japan and England and, among other things, do air-bag advertising. McCormack ended the letter by writing, “I think the association will prove to be — as I always thought it would — one of the most pleasurable and lucrative of your contracts.”
Given the volume of deals McCormack made for Palmer, it is likely that nearly all made them happy and wealthy.
