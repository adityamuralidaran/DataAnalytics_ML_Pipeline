To the Editor:
Re “Loans Flowed to Kushner Cos. After Visits to the White House” (front page, March 1):
I can imagine some of President Trump’s supporters saying: “What is the big deal with foreign leaders trying to influence Jared Kushner? So he has a successful business. So what? It is a win-win for everyone.”
It is a measure of the degree that common sense has been eroded that a deep concern about foreign influence in the Oval Office is not more intense and bipartisan.
It is as though there is no understanding of the genuinely catastrophic results that can flow from foreign influence in the White House. It raises the question as to what is the difference between the nature and extent of Mr. Kushner’s dealings and the business dealings of his father-in-law.
