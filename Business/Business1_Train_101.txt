When Ben Simmons was 14, growing up in Melbourne, Australia, his father turned on a video camera and asked him, “If you had any choice in the world right now, where would you like to play?”
“The N.B.A.,” Simmons replied. “Definitely.”
Simmons was already 6 feet 2 inches, one of the best young basketball players in Australia. He soon moved to Florida, where he played for Montverde Academy, a basketball powerhouse, losing one game in three years. By the time he was a senior, he had grown eight more inches and had developed into a tremendous talent, a big man who could not only finish around the basket but also lead a fast break and throw a mean look-away pass.
In Australia, he said, he never paid attention to the N.C.A.A. tournament, so college ball had no particular meaning for him. Throughout high school, his desire to go straight to the N.B.A. never wavered.
His parents fully supported him. “I think kids should be able to go to the N.B.A. from high school,” his mother, Julie, said.
His father, Dave, a former pro basketball player in Australia, added, “You’re ready, so why can’t you go?”
The reason, of course, was that in 2005, the league and the players’ union had agreed to an age requirement for entering the draft: A player had to be 19 and a year removed from high school.
Thus was born the one-and-done phenomenon, with basketball players accepting college scholarships only to drop out after their freshman year to go pro.
One-and-done players have become commonplace. In this year’s N.B.A. draft, 14 of the first 41 players selected were coming off their freshman seasons at American colleges.
John Calipari of Kentucky was among the first college coaches to openly recruit one-and-dones. Now even former critics, like Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski, understand that to get the best players, they have to recruit athletes who intend to leave after a year.
Simmons was last season’s best-known one-and-done. He wound up at Louisiana State University not because it had a chance to go deep in the tournament (it did not) or because he admired the coach, but because his godfather worked there as an assistant coach. Simmons’s family relocated to Baton Rouge, La., to support him. As it turns out, his parents also took with them two filmmakers, Maura Mandt and Josh Swade, whom they had invited to document their son’s journey to the N.B.A.
The documentary that Mandt and Swade ultimately produced, which will have its premiere on Showtime on Friday, is at once shocking and unsurprising. The film covers Simmons’s last year in high school, the buildup to the draft, his picking of an agent and his signing of a shoe contract, but its primary focus is on that year Simmons spent at L.S.U. Hence its title: “One & Done.”
Most of it takes place off the court. On the court, Simmons had enough good moments last season to solidify his status as a potential No. 1 draft choice, which he indeed became, going to the Philadelphia 76ers. (Alas, he broke his foot during a preseason practice, and it is unclear when he will play in his first N.B.A. game.) But Simmons was often criticized for not taking over games the way a superstar should, and L.S.U. wound up a mediocre 19-14. The Tigers failed to make the N.C.A.A. tournament after losing to Texas A&M in the Southeastern Conference tournament by the humiliating score of 71-38. The next day, Simmons dropped out of school.
In some ways, Simmons was atypical of one-and-done players. As the documentary makes clear, the Simmons family had money; his parents did not need him to get to the N.B.A. for financial reasons.
Simmons is no dummy. Had he been interested in getting a college education, I suspect he would have done well.
But he did not. He simply put in his time — grudgingly — until he could turn pro.
As the documentary shows, Simmons knew, for instance, that he had to get a 1.8 grade-point average in the first semester to be able to play in the second semester. So that was the bar he aimed for.
Although he complains bitterly in the documentary about the N.C.A.A. and the financial exploitation of college athletes, he goes to considerable lengths to avoid even the tiniest financial impropriety, fearing it might hurt him at draft time. Mandt and Swade include a small scene in which Simmons’s sister Emily shows them how she keeps all his receipts in case anybody wants to know how something was paid for.
Mostly, though, Simmons grouses about what a waste of time college is. “The players get nothing,” he says at one point. “They say an education, but if you’re only going to be here a year, that’s not much education.”
Although he does much better than a 1.8 G.P.A. in his first semester, he decides he has had enough and stops going to class once the second semester begins. “I’m here to play,” he explains. “I’m not here to go to school.”
After Simmons starts missing classes, his coach, Johnny Jones, gets after him, warning him that there will be consequences if he does not show up. “I’m going to the N.B.A. next season,” Simmons says when he misses another class. Why pretend “if it’s not going to help me”?
His punishment? Jones benches him for the first 4 minutes 30 seconds of a game against Tennessee. When word leaks out that Simmons had to sit out the beginning of the game for academic reasons, the reporters covering the team want to know the details. “Why didn’t you go to class?” he says to himself as he heads to the news conference, mimicking the reporters. “Well, I can’t get a degree in two semesters, so what’s the point?”
At one point in the documentary, Jalen Rose, who has become an acerbic critic of college sports since his retirement from the N.B.A., says approvingly that Simmons is the first player to really thumb his nose at the system; not only does he not care about academics, but he is willing to say so. Reggie Miller chimes in, “It’s a joke.”
And of course it is. One-and-done basketball players are not “student-athletes”; they are hired guns, here today and gone tomorrow (except, of course, they are not really “hired”). They make a mockery of the N.C.A.A.’s supposed emphasis on academics. Their presence accentuates the hypocrisy that is inherent when institutions that exist to educate build big-time sports programs whose goals are winning, generating revenue and providing mass entertainment.
Jay Bilas, a college basketball analyst for ESPN, told me that the fault lay less with Simmons than with L.S.U. “It has always been in the school’s hands whether a player goes to class or not,” he said after watching the film. “L.S.U. could have demanded that he go to class, irrespective of whether he is a one-and-done. Schools have to decide whether they are going to demand that a player meet a certain standard.”
The only standard L.S.U. held Simmons to was how many points he could score.
Indeed, you cannot blame Simmons for acting the way he did. I have no doubt that there are plenty of other one-and-dones who have acted the same way — and plenty of universities that have enabled them. The one-and-done system is corrosive.
Having said that, I have some sympathy for the N.B.A. for wanting to prevent players from heading to the league straight from high school. Most players coming out of high school simply are not ready for the pros, even though they may think they are. Forcing them to spend a year in college gives them more experience and, yes, makes them more marketable.
Most important, for every Kobe Bryant and LeBron James — players who skipped college and became stars — there are many more who washed out. As Jonathan Abrams points out in “Boys Among Men,” his book about high school players who went straight to the pros, the washouts often rode the bench after being drafted. They never had a chance to get better. Players like Korleone Young, for instance, might have had successful pro careers if they had played in college.
From all indications, the next collective bargaining agreement between the N.B.A. and the players’ union will include the age requirement. The league’s current players aren’t eager to get rid of the rule; they do not want to give up roster spots to high schoolers. Still, everyone — the N.B.A., the players’ union and the N.C.A.A. — ought to be searching for ways to reduce the one-and-dones.
One possible way — and I know this is my hobbyhorse — is to pay the players. No, that would not deter top players like Simmons from leaving after one year, but a system in which players sign contracts with colleges could lead players to stay in school longer because they are contractually obliged to.
Another possibility might be for the N.B.A. to switch the emphasis of its Development League from winning to training, as in minor league baseball, so that high school players who did not want to go to college would have a place to learn their trade. Improving salaries and adding some marketing pizazz wouldn’t hurt, either.
Donna Lopiano, the founder of Sports Management Resources and a member of the Drake Group, which pushes for academic integrity in college sports, had another idea, one that the universities themselves could institute. After watching “One & Done,” she told me that “freshman eligibility makes one-and-done possible.” If you made freshmen ineligible to play football or men’s basketball — as was the case before 1972 — the athletes who wanted to go to school would do so, and those who did not would gravitate to Europe or the D-League.
“One & Done” will undoubtedly stir outrage among traditional college sports reformers like the Drake Group and the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, as well it should. But the reformers cannot fix the problem; they don’t have the power. That is up to the N.B.A., the players’ union and the N.C.A.A. What do you say, folks?
