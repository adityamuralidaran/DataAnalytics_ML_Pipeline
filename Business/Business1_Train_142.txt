HP Inc. said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire Samsung Electronics Company’s printer business in a deal valued at $1.05 billion.
The deal, HP said, would position it to disrupt and reinvent the $55 billion copier industry by mounting a push to replace office copy machines with multifunction printers.
The company said the sector required innovation, describing copiers as “outdated, complicated machines with dozens of replaceable parts requiring inefficient service and maintenance agreements.”
HP said the transaction would also strengthen its position in the global laser printing sector, where it has a long-running partnership with Canon.
The Samsung printer business has more than 6,500 printing patents and a work force of 6,000, including nearly 1,300 researchers and engineers, HP said. The printing unit had revenue of about $1.8 billion in 2015.
Hewlett-Packard split into two companies about 10 months ago: HP Enterprise focuses on selling hardware like servers to corporate customers, and HP specializes in personal computers and printers.
Last week, HP Enterprise agreed to sell its software assets to Micro Focus of Britain for about $8.8 billion.
“The acquisition of Samsung’s printer business allows us to deliver print innovation and create entirely new business opportunities with far better efficiency, security and economics for customers,” Dion Weisler, president and chief executive of HP, said in a news release.
The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close within a year.
Samsung has agreed to make an equity investment valued at $100 million to $300 million through open-market stock purchases after the deal is completed.
