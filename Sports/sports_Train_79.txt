The male-fantasy earmarks of “Lost in Florence,” a guy-perspective romance written and directed by Evan Oppenheimer, are hard to ignore, but it’s still a reasonably pleasant film. Florence looks great; the cast is appealing; and you’ll learn about a rough-and-tumble sport you may not have encountered before.
Eric (Brett Dalton) and his girlfriend, Colleen (Emily Atack), are visiting Italy when he decides to propose, and is rejected. Colleen goes home to the States to think it over, but Eric stays in Florence, where he discovers two things: a local sport called calcio storico, and an attractive local woman, Stefania (Alessandra Mastronardi).
Calcio storico, a team sport, is what you might get if you put soccer, American football, rugby and boxing into a blender. It’s bone-crunching and virtually rule-free. Back in the United States, Eric had come close to making the National Football League, and he finds that his abilities transfer well to calcio storico. Unfortunately, the leader of the team he talks his way onto, Paolo (Alessandro Preziosi), also happens to be Stefania’s boyfriend.
Things go pretty much where a reader of lad magazines would want them to: climactic game decided at the last second; two gorgeous women competing for the same man. The story may not stay with you, but don’t be surprised if you come away with a strong desire to visit Florence.
