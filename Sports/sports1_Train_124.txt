Tony Dorsett, the college and pro football Hall of Famer, said he would not discourage young players from taking up the game even as he battles brain disease. Dorsett, the 1976 Heisman Trophy winner while playing at Pittsburgh, spoke Saturday before the Panthers played No. 8 Notre Dame. He was found within the past year to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
Dorsett, 61, said his goal was to “stay in the fight, fight as long as I can and if I can beat it, beat it.” Dorsett refused to place blame on the game itself, saying there were many football players who enjoyed long careers and never faced issues of repetitive head trauma. He added that if he had a child wanting to play today, he would “be right there behind him 100 percent.”
