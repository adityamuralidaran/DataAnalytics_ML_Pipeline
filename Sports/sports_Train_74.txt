SATURDAY PUZZLE — Have you grown weary of greeting new constructors? We have another debut this week, by Steve Overton and it’s a very interesting one: It’s clean, it’s interesting and Mr. Overton has craftily sneaked his name into the crossword at 12D.
Well, sort of; the answer is OVERTONE, as in “Suggestion,” but that’s close enough for me.
There’s not a whole lot here that’s new, but there are some lively entries. I always like a bit of DERRING DO in my grid, and LET US PRAY makes a comeback after a 35-year hiatus. I also liked G.I. JANE, NO CAN DO and DREAM ON.
Finally, check out the end of this column for some exciting Will Shortz news.
■ 22A: This was a tough one for me. Now that I’ve solved it, it’s pretty obvious, but if you have long ODDS on something, it’s unlikely to happen.
■ 25A: I don’t care what people say about pop culture. “Prince George’s mom,” KATE, is how I broke into today’s puzzle.
■ 36D: #TIL all about a drink I had never heard of before. Here is a history of the SANGAREE.
■ 42D: Everyone, all together now: “But it’s a dry heat.” Sorry, the mention of “Western heat?” made me daydream about warmer climes. The answer is SIX GUN.
I would say you accomplished your task, Mr. OVERTONE.
Your thoughts?
