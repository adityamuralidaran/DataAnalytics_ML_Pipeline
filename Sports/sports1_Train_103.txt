The hoodie, the streetwear insignia of rappers, hackers and girls with forbidding tattoos, reared its head unexpectedly this week in a surfeit of springtime tints, weights and forms.
An anchor of most casual winter wardrobes, it is cementing its status as a look for all seasons, one that can, when the moment is right, stand in for a biker coat, blazer or poncho.
Hoodies, which came out in force in any number of shows, were as mutable as an April day, but most always appeared with kangaroo pouches and drawstrings intact.
At Yeezy, Kanye West served up this locker-room classic with bellows pockets, and in another instance, a version that dipped to mid-thigh. Shayne Oliver of Hood by Air favored a similarly attenuated look, while Rio Uribe of Gypsy Sport added cascades of fringe.
Telfar Clemens lopped off the sleeves of his jaunty striped hoodie, and Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chow of DKNY reinvented the standard in cornflower blue tulle, a dainty way to go undercover for spring.
