To the Editor:
Fish have all the impressive qualities that Jonathan Balcombe described, and more (“Fishes Have Feelings, Too,” Sunday Review, May 15). They are admirable, sentient beings that deserve our respect and compassion.
There is no humane way to fish. Even fish that are caught and released as “sport” often die from the resultant injury and trauma. Countless animals are indiscriminately caught and killed with fishing gear, while yet more are killed for competing with humans for fish.
Human slavery is rampant in the fishing industry, and fish farming entails its own set of grave problems.
Seafood certification systems try to address some of these problems but do so dubiously at best. They do not address myriad assaults the fish are subjected to, whether wild caught or farmed, and they all suffer immensely.
All the nutrients we need to thrive can be obtained more healthfully, humanely and environmentally responsibly from plant sources. This includes marvelous vegan versions of virtually every type of seafood imaginable.
Respect fish: Don’t eat them.
