ON THE RIVER MAULLÍN, Chile — Eight thousand miles is a long way to go to catch a trout. But there I was, balancing precariously in a boat on a river in Chile, having my first lesson in fly-fishing. The tranquillity of the scene was disturbed only by the gurgling of the water and the murmured instructions of my teacher. And my noisy flailing about as I tried to keep my balance while standing up in the boat.
It had long been my ambition to go fly-fishing. It seemed to be a clever game of aqueous cat and mouse alluringly set in tumbling rivers or by the still waters of a mountain lake. But where to go? There are trout lakes less than an hour’s drive from my home in London, but that lacks romance. New Zealand? Canada? Both popular with the fishing fraternity. I chose Chile, that intriguing stiletto of a country 2,653 miles long and an average of 110 miles wide, with inhospitable deserts to the north; vineyards, lakes and rivers in the middle; and to the south, mighty mountains and glaciers.
We stayed in the capital for three days — long enough for my wife to fracture her ankle on one of Santiago’s rugged sidewalks — before driving south to the Lake District on our way to our destination, the Maullín River near the port city of Puerto Montt. We flew the 430 miles to the city of Temuco, hired a tank of a Toyota and set off on a modest road trip.
Some of the journey was on rutted dirt roads, up and down forested mountainsides in a cloud of dust. The rest was on asphalt alongside lakes and rivers with exotic names such as Panguipulli and Riñihue, given to them by the Mapuche tribes who lived in the area until the Spanish arrived in the 16th century. And all against the backdrop of the Andes and some of the country’s 2,000 volcanoes. The lakeside resort towns are distinctly Teutonic, with timber houses and twin-spired churches, a reminder that the area was settled by thousands of Germans in the mid-19th century. (Their other legacy is küchen, cakes stuffed with fruit and walnuts.)
Then came the fishing. I headed for the Senda Nativa Romahue, a private nature reserve on the banks of the Maullín that had been recommended by a local tour operator, 20 dusty miles from the hotel. There I met Claudio Redlich, my fishing tutor, keen-eyed, sure of touch, skills honed by 35 years of experience.
In my mind’s eye I had seen myself in chest-high waders, straining against a raging torrent. But no. We went to a small lagoon – actually more of a big pond – surrounded by thick trees, like a mangrove swamp. Was it what I had come all this way for? Even to an absolute beginner, the spot looked tame.
But Mr. Redlich unhitched the boat and poled us toward the low-lying forest that surrounds the pond. A gap little wider than the boat materialized, allowing us to glide silently along through a tunnel of trees.
He explained that the Maullín flows on a glacial murrain so the trees float on the water in a dense mass. If you were to fly over the area, the Chilean myrtles would look like a solid undergrowth, their fragrant white flowers contrasting with the red petals of a parasite creeper called the medalitta.
We emerged into what appeared to be another lagoon but was actually the fast-moving Maullín on its way from its source, Lake Llanquihue, to the Pacific about 80 miles west.
Mr. Redlich spared me any complex discussion about fishing rods — short rods are used on small rivers, larger ones on big lakes, for example — but he did explain the science of the fly.
Each one has to look like and behave like an insect, something the fish would eat. Some flies are used with a heavier line so they sink to attract low-swimming fish, others float lightly on the water’s surface. He rummaged in a tin of many-hued feathered lures and chose the Simulator, with its reddish body and straw-colored spikes.
He set me up with a Streamer, which has dashes of orange and red, and, he assured me, would prove irresistible to the brown and rainbow trout lurking beneath the surface.
That’s the science; what about casting? “Watch me,” he instructed and sent his line floating off effortlessly in a clean, gliding action that landed the fly 30 or 40 feet away. Just where he intended. He caught a trout, of course, with his second cast.
I tried, swaying uncertainly in the boat, worried that my casting would take out someone’s eye. My attempt ended in an untidy swirl of line that tangled in the air and flopped onto the water, where it floated limply.
“Don’t flick your wrist,” he said. “Keep the arm and rod straight and move them as if they are one unit from nine to one o’clock, then let the energy in the rod cast the line. Use the line in the free hand to control its flight.”
I have to confess — though I did not admit it at the time — that this was not, strictly speaking, my first lesson in the difficult art of casting. No. I had been taken by a friend to a park in central London where, to the puzzlement of dog walkers, I spent an hour desperately trying to keep my arm straight, not flick my wrist, all of the above, and failed to catch even a leaf.
Back on the water, I tried again. Hopeless. The ibis patrolling the river honked in derision.
We moved downstream because our noise had disturbed the fish. I still was not catching a thing, not a nibble, and my shoulder was beginning to ache from my clumsy casting. I took consolation from the pleasure of being on the river, disturbed only by the strident call of the chucao, a bird considered holy by the Huilliche tribe that once lived in the region.
But then there was a tug on the line. A distinct pull. A trout. I’d caught a trout. Pure elation. I reeled it in clumsily, surprised at the strength of something that was only about 14 inches long and weighed less than three pounds. Mr. Redlich, almost as pleased as I was, made me pose for a photograph to capture the moment of glory.
We then returned the fish to the water — anything less than nine pounds has to be put back.
I was ready to quit when there was another tug, much more urgent than the first. The rod bent alarmingly. Even I knew it was the big one, seven pounds at least. I reeled in frantically.
But there it went — the one that got away.
As we celebrated my debut catch with a beer, I realized that fly-fishing does not have to be in a foaming river to be a challenge. There is the test that comes with choosing the stretch of water where the fish dally, the right rod, the most suitable fly, the correct weight of line. That’s the science.
Then there is the beautiful art of casting. I asked Mr. Redlich to define how he does it — that effortless, unerring movement — but it would have been like asking Pablo Neruda to parse one of his poems or Lionel Messi to analyze how he beat five people on his way to scoring a goal.
Another 35 years should crack it.
