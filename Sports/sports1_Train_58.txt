There’s a very real possibility that watching “Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV” could result in brain addlement. At least, that’s what it might feel like if you’ve so far managed to resist the lure of the long-running (29 years, no less), rampantly successful Final Fantasy video game franchise. Suffice to say, this spinoff from the story of a magical kingdom besieged by an evil empire is too ludicrous for words.
Even so, no movie this welcoming to silly hats deserves our complete condemnation. Apparently raiding “Game of Thrones,” “Lord of the Rings,” “Star Wars” and “Dune” (sandworms!), the writer and director, Takeshi Nozue, whips up a pop-culture pastiche that leaps from modern cities to medieval castles, and from paved roads to alien moonscapes with head-spinning randomness. But when characters are wedged in the uncanny valley between live action and computer animation (featuring motion-capture wizardry that nevertheless leaves the eyes dead and lids that close with doll-like solemnity), their ability to rescue an incoherent plot is necessarily limited.
Making matters worse, the voice work (notably from Aaron Paul, Sean Bean and Lena Headey) is atrocious. But then, so might yours be if called upon to bark wooden dialogue and names that seem concocted by a desperate Scrabble player who’s run out of vowels. I was devastated to learn, for instance, that the oft-mentioned empire was called Niflheim and not (as everyone seemed to be saying) Nippleheim. Don’t judge: With a project this misbegotten, we grab our amusement where we can.
JEANNETTE CATSOULIS
“Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Wasp waists, bowling-ball buttocks and unironic headgear.
