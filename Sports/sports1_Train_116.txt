International sports officials have occasionally run afoul of their own rules and even the law over the years, from the Olympic officials caught accepting bribes to award the 2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake City, to the soccer officials who were more recently accused of accepting bribes related to TV contracts and World Cup bids.
But perhaps a new low for sports officials has been reached in track and field: Officials are accused of blackmailing some athletes who failed drug tests and choosing not to discipline runners who were suspected of doping.
The accusations were laid out in an 89-page report released on Thursday by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Unlike most sports scandals in the past that involved top officials, this one touches the field of play. The leaders of track and field’s global governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, allowed athletes who had used banned substances to continue competing in major events, according to the report.
“It’s not just a bunch of people sitting at a table passing money to each other,” said Richard W. Pound, a lead author of the report. “This actually affects the outcome of competition.”
The report provided few specific details of individual athletes and competitions they participated in after doping suspicions arose.
Liliya Shobukhova, a Russian distance runner who won three Chicago Marathon titles, was cited by name. She was among those extorted, according to the report. After her name appeared on a list of 23 Russian athletes with suspicious test results in 2011, officials told her to make three payments of nearly $200,000 each in order to compete in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.
Such shakedowns, the report said, were not limited to Ms. Shobukhova, nor to Russian athletes. Asli Cakir Alptekin, a middle-distance runner from Turkey, also paid bribes to officials in late 2012, hoping to keep the gold medal she won at the London Olympics.
Track’s top officials fostered a culture of corruption and recruited family members to join their schemes, the commission said.
Among those implicated in the report are the I.A.A.F.’s longtime president, Lamine Diack of Senegal, and its former treasurer, Valentin Balakhnichev of Russia. High-ranking advisers, including a doctor once in charge of policing doping violations, were also cited.
Mr. Diack, who was arrested in France late last year in connection with the commission’s inquiry, in one instance advised a lawyer that he needed to consult the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, who had become a friend, before processing the doping violations of nine Russian athletes. Mr. Diack is suspected by French prosecutors of having accepted more than $1 million in bribes to cover up positive drug tests.
Mr. Diack presided over the I.A.A.F. for 16 years, hiring his two sons as consultants and drawing them into his schemes, the inquiry found. Mr. Balakhnichev, too, installed his son as an I.A.A.F. employee in Moscow.
Suspicions of bribery related to television broadcast rights and International Olympic Committee votes also surfaced in the group’s investigation. According to the report, Mr. Diack supported Japan’s bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics because it paid $4 million to $5 million in sponsorship money to the I.A.A.F. Tokyo was ultimately selected to host the 2020 Games.
Describing the corruption as “embedded” in the organization, the report said: “It cannot be ignored or dismissed as attributable to the odd renegade acting on his own,” adding, “It is increasingly clear that far more I.A.A.F. staff knew about the problems than has currently been acknowledged.”
The first part of the group’s inquiry concluded in November, with a report that accused Russia of a state-sponsored doping program. Those findings prompted track and field’s governing body to suspend Russia from global competition, jeopardizing its participation in this summer’s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
The second report, released Thursday, shifted attention from Russia to the ruling body that investigators said had enabled it.
The Olympic body said Thursday that it planned to study the report and act as necessary. Last November, after the release of the commission’s first report foreshadowing what could come, the I.O.C. suspended Mr. Diack.
In a statement Thursday, the I.A.A.F. said that it accepted the “extreme gravity” of the report’s findings, noting that weak governance had allowed “individuals at the head of a previous regime” to act poorly.
The report raised questions about both past leaders of track and field and the sport’s celebrated current leader, Sebastian Coe, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who was in charge of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.
Although Thursday’s report said members of the I.A.A.F.’s council “could not have been unaware” of the alleged schemes as they occurred, Mr. Pound emphasized at a news conference in Munich that he believed the organization’s current leader, Mr. Coe, had not been a part of any wrongdoing and had not known about it.
Mr. Coe, who was vice president to Mr. Diack for seven years, called the corruption “totally abhorrent,” adding, “We cannot change the past, but I am determined that we will learn from it and will not repeat its mistakes.”
Authorities have reacted to the commission’s yearlong inquiry. In addition to Mr. Diack’s arrest, Habib Cisse, Mr. Diack’s legal adviser, and Gabriel Dollé, a former director of the I.A.A.F.’s antidoping division, are under criminal investigation in France. None are currently working for the I.A.A.F.
French authorities are continuing their investigation into the matter, they said Thursday. Interpol, the international police organization, is also leading a continuing global inquiry. The organization has put out a wanted notice for one of Mr. Diack’s sons, Papa Massata Diack, who worked as a marketing consultant. Last week, the I.A.A.F. announced it had barred him from any future work in track and field.
Mr. Coe has recognized in recent weeks that the sport and his organization are in crisis. Last week, perhaps acting pre-emptively, he announced that he had hired a team of outside lawyers and accountants to conduct an internal investigation at the I.A.A.F. He said he planned to institute stricter organizational controls and double the antidoping budget by midyear.
The three-person commission that wrote Thursday’s report was created in December 2014. It consisted of Mr. Pound, founding president of the World Anti-Doping Agency; Richard H. McLaren, a Canadian lawyer; and Günter Younger, the head of cybercrime for the police in the German state Bavaria.
The commission’s investigation was inspired by reports from the German public broadcaster ARD, which released a documentary in December 2014 focused on doping in Russian athletics.
On Thursday, the commission focused on what it called a corrupt administration.
“You’ve got to have 21st-century governance,” Mr. Pound said, “even if it’s an organization that’s 19th century in origin.”
