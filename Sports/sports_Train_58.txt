You have a nimble mind and speedy fingers, but you are dumb and wrong. Speed-cubing is not a sport because it does not involve physical exertion and/or risk. Auto racing is a sport because you can die. (Poker is not a sport; it is a game.) What’s more, most sports derive from the ancient practice of giving young warriors something to do when not killing. This martial aspect is why archery is a sport but darts isn’t, because darts can’t kill. Erno Rubik is not a warrior but an architect, academic and nerd: He built a cube to solve, not a ball to hit. Honor that distinction.
