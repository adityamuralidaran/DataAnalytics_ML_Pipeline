The Metropolitan Museum of Art has just added a little more time to see “Manus x Machina: Fashion in the Age of Technology.” Six hours, to be exact.
On Sept. 2 and 3, during the exhibition’s final weekend, the Met will keep its doors open until midnight, an extra three hours. The museum’s other galleries will be closed, but the exhibition, the Great Hall Balcony Bar — and the “Manus x Machina” exhibition shop, of course — will be open for business.
This adds to the already prolonged farewell to the show, which explores the convergence of couture and technology and was originally slated to close on Aug. 14.
Extended hours have been the norm for the Costume Institute’s hits: The museum stayed open late on the final weekends of “Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty” in 2011 and “China: Through the Looking Glass” last year. Those exhibitions and this year’s were organized by Andrew Bolton.
“Manus x Machina,” which transformed the Met’s Robert Lehman Wing with a design by the New York office of Rem Koolhaas’s Office for Metropolitan Architecture, has attracted over 664,000 visitors so far. That makes it one of the Met’s most-visited exhibitions, and the second-most-attended Costume Institute show — ahead of McQueen but behind “China: Through the Looking Glass,” which brought in nearly 816,000 visitors.
