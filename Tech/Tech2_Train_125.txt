LONDON — HSBC said on Monday that it would move 840 jobs in its information technology division out of Britain to lower-cost countries such as India as part of an effort to reduce its expenses.
The bank announced plans last year to shed as many as 50,000 jobs by the end of next year by selling underperforming businesses, exiting some markets and reducing the size of its global investment banking business. Those job reductions included about 8,000 positions in Britain.
As of the end of last year, the bank employed 255,000 people.
On Monday, it said it would shift 840 information technology roles to lower-cost countries by the end of March 2017 as part of those expense-reduction efforts.
“The U.K. will continue to play an important role in HSBC’s global I.T. infrastructure, employing several thousand I.T. professionals,” John Hackett, the chief operating officer of HSBC U.K., said in a news release.
As part of its reshaping last year, HSBC said it would increase its investment in Asia, where it generates more than half of its earnings.
The bank traces its roots to Hong Kong and was called the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation when it was founded. It conducted a formal review last year on whether to move its headquarters from Britain, but in February opted to stay in London.
