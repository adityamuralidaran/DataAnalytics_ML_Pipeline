A slide in technology and consumer-focused companies helped pull Wall Street indexes modestly lower on Thursday, offsetting strong energy sector gains.
A broad swath of retailers, from department stores to fast-food chains, also notched losses. Most of the big gainers were oil production and drilling companies.
They got help from a report indicating fuel stockpiles fell precipitously last week. The price of benchmark crude also jumped on the report, and closed nearly 5 percent higher.
United States bond yields also surged, as traders reacted to the European Central Bank’s decision to leave its key interest rates unchanged and hold off on extending a stimulus program.
Still, in the absence of any major new economic data, the stock indexes continued a recent pattern of mostly sluggish trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 46.23 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 18,479.91. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index slid 4.86 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,181.30.
The sell-off in technology stocks weighed on the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 24.44 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,259.48.
Apple slid 2.6 percent a day after the consumer electronics giant introduced its newest line of products, including a new iPhone that does not come with an analog headphone jack. The stock shed $2.84 to close at $105.52.
Investors also got a dash of tech sector deal news. Hewlett Packard Enterprise agreed to spin off part of its business software unit to Micro Focus in a deal valued at $8.8 billion. The pact calls for H.P.E. to remain majority owner of the new company. Shares in H.P.E. slid 71 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $21.38.
Tractor Supply, the farming and hardware goods retailer, slumped 16.9 percent after the company said its business was being hurt by poor economic conditions in the rural, energy-producing areas where it does most of its business, as well as other factors. The stock shed $14.15, closing at $69.38.
Pier 1 Imports, the home décor retailer, tumbled 15 percent after it gave weak quarterly guidance and said its president and chief executive would leave the company at the end of the year. The stock slid 72 cents to close at $4.08.
Several oil drilling and production companies rose on the latest oil stockpile figures. Chesapeake Energy rose 93 cents, or 13.7 percent, to $7.74, the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500 index. Diamond Offshore Drilling gained $1.43, or 9 percent, to close at $17.40.
Traders also bid up crude oil prices. Benchmark crude rose $2.12, or 4.7 percent, to $47.62 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $2.01, or 4.2 percent, to $49.99 in London.
The news out of the European Central Bank helped ease demand for United States bonds, driving their prices lower and pushing yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.60 percent from 1.54 percent late Wednesday.
At a news conference, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, seemed relatively confident about the economy and less inclined to hint at more stimulus than some analysts had expected. He urged governments to do their part.
The E.C.B.’s decisions weighed on Europe’s major stock indexes. The German DAX fell 0.7 percent, while the CAC-40 in France declined 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares rose 0.2 percent.
Earlier, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong gained 0.8 percent. The South Korean Kospi added 0.1 percent, while the Sensex in India rose 0.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 0.3 percent.
Among metals, gold slid $7.50, to $1,336.80 an ounce, while silver fell 17 cents, to $19.68 an ounce. Copper was even at $2.10 a pound.
In currency markets, the dollar strengthened to 102.51 yen from 101.73 on Wednesday. The euro climbed to $1.1254 from $1.1240.
