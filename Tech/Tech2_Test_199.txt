Google disputed on Thursday claims made by Europe’s antitrust officials that it had used Android, the company’s dominant mobile operating system, to unfairly promote its own services like online search and its smartphone application store over those of rivals.
The Silicon Valley company said that customers and cellphone makers could easily switch to competitors’ services and use rival smartphone applications, though rivals have balked at such suggestions.
“The Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers and mobile network operators,” Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, said in a blog post on Thursday. “Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it.”
If the charges (and denials) sound familiar, it’s because they are.
For years, the European authorities investigated Microsoft over whether the company had abused its dominance to promote its own services. Microsoft eventually — some say reluctantly — agreed to give rivals greater access.
As in the Google case, Europe’s antitrust officials put themselves at the center of how people, both in the region and farther afield, used digital services. European officials have said the two companies’ practices not only stopped rivals from competing directly, but also limited consumer choice and, in the case of Google, hindered innovation in the fast-expanding mobile world.
The cases against Google and Microsoft, however, are not identical.
Microsoft: In 2009, the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, charged Microsoft with unfairly bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows software, a move that officials said reduced consumer choice.
The claims came on the heels of a separate antitrust investigation into whether Microsoft broke European competition rules by unfairly promoting its Windows Media Player over alternatives offered by rivals.
Google: In April, the Europe competition authorities charged the search giant with unfairly using Android, which holds a roughly 75 percent share of the region’s smartphone market, to promote its own digital services over those of rivals.
Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s antitrust chief, said Google had required some cellphone manufacturers to preinstall the company’s services, including its Google Play smartphone application store, and had given them unfair financial incentives to favor Google’s services on their mobile devices.
Microsoft: At the time of the 2009 charges, Microsoft was trying — unsuccessfully — to cement its place in the world of internet services.
That included automatically including Internet Explorer with every version of Windows, which was then used on about 90 percent of all computers worldwide. Internet Explorer held more than a 50 percent share of Europe’s browser market when the charges were filed.
Google: Google hopes Android will give it an edge over rivals like Facebook in the mobile market. The question is whether the company hindered competition by requiring cellphone makers to use services like online search and the mobile version of Chrome, if they wanted to use other products like Google Play.
Google says that people can easily download rival services and that it does not restrict them from using competitors’ applications. The company says its relationships with cellphone manufacturers are voluntary and it does not receive direct payments for these companies’ use of its Android software.
Microsoft: To settle the Internet Explorer case, Microsoft created an online portal in 2009 that allowed people to choose freely between a number of browsers.
It dropped the feature, however, from some of its Windows software in 2011 and was hit with a further $730 million punishment in 2013 for failing to respect the original antitrust settlement. In all, it has paid $3.4 billion in fines to the European Commission for its antitrust abuses.
Google: If found to have broken Europe’s tough competition rules, Google could be fined up to $7.5 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, though European officials have typically levied much smaller penalties in previous cases.
Microsoft: After it opened itself up to greater competition, Microsoft soon began to lose ground to rivals, particularly Google’s Chrome browser. Chrome is now the region’s main internet browser, and Internet Explorer holds about a 10 percent market share.
These changes, though, were not caused solely by Europe’s competition investigation. Microsoft also did not keep pace with rivals like Google and Facebook, failed to shift gears successfully toward mobile (including the disastrous purchase, and subsequent write-down, of Nokia’s mobile handset and services unit in 2014) and became mired in lengthy antitrust litigation in both the United States and Europe.
Google: This is still up in the air. Much will depend on the result of the Android antitrust case and any likely appeal by Google. An initial decision is expected sometime late next year, at the earliest (the company also faces two separate competition charges linked to some of its online search activities).
If it is found to have broken European rules, the company could face financial penalties, calls to alter its mobile operating system or both.
There is a lot at stake for Google. It has pegged much of its future growth on mobile, with Android at the heart of most of these activities. Other American technology companies like Facebook and Amazon are also fighting to win people’s attention on smartphones.
So any restrictions on Google’s mobile ambitions, either in Europe or outside the region, are likely to raise concerns about the company’s growth plans.
