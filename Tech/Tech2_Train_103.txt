Let’s face it: You’re probably not thinking about technology right now. You’re watching highlights of Sunday night’s presidential debate. You’re tweeting about it. Reading about it. Captivated by the latest outrage that makes Nixon’s flop sweat in the Kennedy debate seem, well, not exactly a big deal.
But when you woke up in the morning to tune into the latest crazy moment in this endless election, the tech-savvy among you probably asked your Alexa or your Cortana or some other artificially intelligent computing voice to find the morning’s news. And that voice most likely sounded like a young woman.
Why is that? The big tech companies have discovered through research that this is the voice people most want to hear. There may be an underlying stereotype to this: We consider these devices to be assistants and we associate “assistant” with a young woman.
As Jason Mars, an African-American computer science professor who also has a start-up that uses an artificially intelligent voice, told Quentin Hardy: “There’s a kind of pressure to conform to the prejudices of the world” when you are trying to make a consumer hit. “It would be interesting to have a black guy talk, but we don’t want to create friction, either. First we need to sell products.”
