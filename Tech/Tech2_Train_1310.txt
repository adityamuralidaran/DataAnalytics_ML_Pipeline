“Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology” is on its way to becoming the latest blockbuster for the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Seen by more than 350,000 visitors in the two months since it opened, on May 5, the exhibition has been extended through Labor Day, Sept. 5. It was originally set to close on Aug. 14.
The show’s traffic is averaging slightly less than that of last year’s “China: Through the Looking Glass,” which drew 815,992 visitors in its roughly four months and set an attendance record for the Costume Institute. The 2011 exhibition “Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty” had previously held the record, with 661,509 visitors, but that was before the Met moved from its six- to seven-day-a-week schedule in 2013. (All three were organized by Andrew Bolton.)
“Manus x Machina,” sponsored by Apple and designed by the New York office of Rem Koolhaas’s Office for Metropolitan Architecture, showcases the convergence of couture and technology in high-fashion houses. Whether it will also receive late-night viewing hours, as did the China and McQueen shows, has yet to be determined.
