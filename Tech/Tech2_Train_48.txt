The Netflix documentary “Audrie & Daisy” is intended to spread awareness of teenage sexual assaults and how technology can amplify their ramifications.
It focuses on two cases. The first, from Saratoga, Calif., involves Audrie Pott, who committed suicide in 2012, days after an incident at a party when she was unconscious. Three boys later admitted in juvenile court that they had sexually penetrated Audrie while she was intoxicated and possessed lewd photos of her on cellphones.
The other is a widely publicized case from Maryville, Mo., in which a former high school football player, Matthew B. Barnett, was initially charged with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl in 2012. (He was 17 at the time.) Those charges were dropped, but after public outrage and a review of the case, he ultimately pleaded guilty to endangering the welfare of a child.
The movie, directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk, is, among other things, a vehicle for Daisy Coleman, the Missouri victim. She and her family came forward to share the repercussions of the episode. (The family moved after feeling ostracized in Maryville, which then had a population of about 12,000.)
The film’s slick presentation includes visuals of online chatter and a manipulative score. It’s revealed toward the end that two of the defendants from Ms. Pott’s case appeared in the documentary, with their identities obscured, as part of the settlement of a suit brought by her family.
“Audrie & Daisy” is strongest when it investigates what it regards as shortcomings of justice, for reasons technical and implied: The special prosecutor in the Coleman case says certain legal standards can be difficult to meet. In an eyebrow-raising moment, the sheriff for Maryville holds forth on how “girls have as much culpability in this world as boys do.”
