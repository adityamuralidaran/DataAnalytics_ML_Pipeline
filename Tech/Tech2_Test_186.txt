What a long road it has been. And now we are finally here: Election Day.
Over the last few months, New York Times reporters have written often about technology and the election. More than in most previous presidential campaigns, technology has played a central role. Technology has been at the root of Donald J. Trump’s use of Twitter, the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and fears that hackers might disrupt the vote.
Technology also provides useful tools. So Times reporters have chronicled how it can aid you on Election Day. We compiled a selection of some of those articles below, in case you are looking for apps or social media to help with voting information and more.
■ What to expect while voting
■ Facebook’s vote planner tool to help people become more informed
■ Apps for keeping up with election issues, registering to vote and seeing candidates’ positions
