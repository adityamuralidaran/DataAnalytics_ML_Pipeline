Are you watching the 2018 Winter Olympics? If so, what has been most striking to you about this season’s Games? Who have had the most notable athletic performances so far?
In “This Is Peak Olympics,” Stuart A. Thompson and Jessia Ma write:
Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:
— Are you convinced by the authors that we have reached “Peak Olympics”? Why or why not? What hard or anecdotal evidence do you have to support or challenge their opinion?
— Can you think of any other examples of sports that use technology? How do they use it? How has it changed the sport over time?
— Do you think athletes should be able to use technology to improve their performance? Or does it give some athletes an unfair advantage? Does it diminish or strengthen individuals’ talent and the sport over all? Why do you think so?
— If you do think technology is acceptable in sports, should there be any limits on the amount or type of equipment that athletes can use? Is there any advancement that could be considered going too far or cheating? Or is it all fair game? Why?
