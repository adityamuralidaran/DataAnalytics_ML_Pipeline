To the Editor:
In “Downgrade Your Life” (Sunday Review, Aug. 20), about reducing the intrusive effects of technology at home, Pamela Paul includes some benign choices: switching from an electric to a manual toothbrush, or getting DVDs by mail instead of streaming movies.
But choosing to keep old laptops around — to say nothing of refusing firmware/software updates — is not at all a benign choice. It introduces dangerous security vulnerabilities in a world of billions of connected computers and devices, presenting ripe targets for the spread of malware and other cyber exploits.

We live in a world of devices. They’re quickly becoming our vices. Life feels like a fiction, Or just an addiction, While feeding on each daily crisis.
